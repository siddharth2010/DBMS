My implementation of B-tree and B+ tree with
1. Odd size of non-leaf nodes
2. Even size of leaf nodes in B+ tree (Odd in case of B-tree)
3. Splitting only when necessary

I extended my B-Tree implementation so used same class for defining both leaf and non-leaf nodes. It simplified coding but I am storing some unnecessary information.
